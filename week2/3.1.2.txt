Allow the user to input numbers, add them and print the result.																									
																									
Problem statement: Create a simple program. The program should prompt the numbers,  calculate their sum and then display this sum.																									
																									
Questions:																									
1.Is there a limit of inputs? Min 2 max 50.																			
2. Are there several input fields (one per number) or one? One.																			
3. If there is only one, what is the correct input? Is there a separator per number (e.g. comma and/or space)? Comma, space is optional																			
																									
Test cases:	
What if character/ special symbol/ punctuation mark except comma is prompted?
    1,@,7,3 => false	1,2,7,3 => true	1, 2, 7, 3 => true																	
What if only 1 number is prompted?					
    1 => false	1, 2 => true																		
What if input field is empty?					
    "" => false																			
What if input field has no separators?					
    01226354 => false																			
																									
																									
Input constraints: 
    only numbers can be used																								
	max numbers 50, min 2																								
	separator - comma, space optional																								
																									
Input:	Input numbers in one field, seperated by comma																								
Process:	calculate the sum of the numbers																								
Output:	sum																								
																									
Program																							
	INITIALIZE userInput AS String;																								
	INITIALIZE counter;																								
	INITIALIZE numbersList AS List;																								
	INITIALIZE totalAmount as 0;																						
																									
	PROMPT "Please input minimum 2 and maximum 50 numbers (using numbers 0-9), separated by commas" AS userInput																								
	SPLIT userInput AT THE SEPARATOR "," TO numbersList // check for spaces, are there commas in the string																								
																									
	FOR EACH item OF numbersList 																								
		IF not a number																							
		Display ("Please make sure that you only add numbers")																							
		then go to PROMPT
        ELSE,
            add 1 to COUNT numbers
        IF COUNT is less than 2 and more than 50
            Display "The entered row should be from 2 to 50 numbers."
        then go back to PROMPT
        Else,
																																																																						
	COUNT sum of numbers in the numbersList as totalAmount																								
																									
	DISPLAY "The sum is " + totalAmount
