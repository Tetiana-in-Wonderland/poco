Allow the user to input numbers, subtract the smaller from the bigger number and print the result.								
								
Problem statement: Create a simple program. The program should prompt 2 numbers, compare them, subtract the smaller from the bigger and print the result.								
								
Questions:								
Is there a limit of inputs? Fixed quantity of numbers is 2.		
Are there several input fields (one per digit) or one? One.		
If there is only one, how is the correct input? Is there a seperator per digit (e.g. comma and/or space)? Comma, space is optional		
								
Test cases:	
What if character/ special symbol/ punctuation mark except comma is prompted? 					
    1,@,7,3 => false	1,2,7,3 => true	1, 2, 7, 3 => true
What if only 1 number is prompted?					
    1 => false	1, 2 => true	
What if input field is empty?					
    "" => false		
What if input field has no separators?					
    01226354 => false		
								
Input constraints: 	
    only numbers can be used							
	fixed amount of numbers 2							
	separator - comma, space							
								
Input:	Input 2 numbers in one field, separated by comma							
Process:	compare the numbers							
Output:	The greater number of X and Y is ..
