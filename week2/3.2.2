Write a program that asks the user for a date. Find the day of the year for the given date. For example,
January 1st would be 1, and December 31st is 365.
a) Do not include leap years.
b) Include leap years. Check the rules for leap years on the internet, and implement them in your program.

Problem statement: The program should ask user to prompt the date. Then the program should display day of the year as an index number. 

Input: full date
Input constraints: a) fixed quamtity of index number options is 365 b) fixed quamtity number of index number options is 365 or 366

Input constraints: 	
    only numbers can be used in th input field																							
	insertion format is dd/mm/yyyy
    separator used - slash																																															
																									
Input:	Fill date in one field, in format dd/mm/yyyy																								
Processes: calculate day index number																							
Output:	index number of the day of the year

A) Program without leap/non-leap year
    Initialize yearDay as ""
    Initialize inputDay as ""
    Initialize inputMonth as ""
    Initialize inputYear as ""
    Initialize daysnumber[inputmonth] as
        January=0
        February=31
        March=59
        April=90
        May=120
        June=151
        July=181
        August=212
        September=243
        October=273
        November=304
        December=334

    PROMPT "Day" as inputDay
    PROMPT "Month" as inputMonth
    PROMPT "Year" as inputYear

    COUNT daysnumber[inputMonth]+inputDay=yearDay

    DISPLAY "Day of the year is "+yearDay

    B) Program for leap/non-leap year
    Initialize yearDay as ""
    Initialize inputDay as ""
    Initialize inputMonth as ""
    Initialize inputYear as ""
    Initialize daysnumber[inputMonth] as
        January=0
        February=31
        March=59
        April=90
        May=120
        June=151
        July=181
        August=212
        September=243
        October=273
        November=304
        December=334

    Initialize daysnumber[leapinputMonth] as
        January=0
        February=31
        March=60
        April=91
        May=121
        June=152
        July=182
        August=213
        September=244
        October=274
        November=305
        December=335

    PROMPT "Day" as inputDay
    PROMPT "Month" as inputMonth
    PROMPT "Year" as inputYear

    If inputYear/4=wholenumber
        inputMonth=leapinputMonth
        COUNT daysnumber[leapinputMonth]+inputDay=yearDay
        DISPLAY "Day of the year is "+yearDay
    ELSE 
        COUNT daysnumber[inputMonth]+inputDay=yearDay
END
