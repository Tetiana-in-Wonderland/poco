Task: Write a sort algorithm yourself. (e.g. bubble sort)

1. Initialize list of numbers NUMBERS_TO_SORT [2,3,1]

2. set SWAPPED to false

3. Initialize CURRENT_INDEX TO 0

4. Compare the item at CURRENT_INDEX with the item at CURRENT_INDEX+1
5. If first item was bigger than second, 
        swap them 
        set SWAPPED to true
    endif
    add 1 to CURRENT_INDEX
    if CURRENT_INDEX is smaller than the length of NUMBERS_TO_SORT -1, go back to step 4

if SWAPPED is true, go back to step 2
Display "The list is now sorted"
