Task: Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater. Log the output, e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. "The smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."								
								
Problem statement: Create a simple program. The program should prompt 2 numbers, compare them and print the message about which number is bigger								
								
Questions:								
Is there a limit of inputs? Fixed quantity of numbers is 2.		
Are there several input fields (one per number) or one? One.		
If there is only one, how is the correct input? Is there a seperator per number (e.g. comma and/or space)? Comma, space is optional.		
								
Test cases:	
What if character/ special symbol/ punctuation mark except comma is prompted?
    1,@,7,3 => false	1,2,7,3 => true	1, 2, 7, 3 => true
What if only 1 number is prompted?					
    1 => false	1, 2 => true	
What if input field is empty?					
    "" => false		
What if input field has no separators?
    01226354 => false		
								
Input constraints: only numbers can be used							
	fixed quantity of numbers is 2							
	separator - comma, space							
								
Input:	Input 2 numbers in one field, separated by comma							
Process:	compare the numbers							
Output:	The greater number of X and Y is ..							
														

Program																							
	INITIALIZE userInput AS String;																								
	INITIALIZE counter;																								
	INITIALIZE numbersList AS List;																								
																									
	PROMPT "Please input 2 numbers, separated by commas" AS userInput																								
	SPLIT userInput AT THE SEPARATOR "," TO numbersList // check for spaces, are there commas in the string																								
																									
	FOR EACH item OF numbersList 																								
		IF not a number																							
		Display ("Please make sure that you only add numbers")																							
		then go to PROMPT
        
        ELSE,
            SUBTRACT number2 from number1							
                IF result is negative,						
                    DISPLAY "The greater number of number1 and number2 is number2"						
                ELSEIF result equals zero,						
                    DISPLAY "number1 and number2 are equal"
