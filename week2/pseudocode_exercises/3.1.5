Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.																									

Problem statement: The program should ask the user to insert 2 numbers. Then the program should ask if user wants to add or subtract two numbers, calculate and print the result of the chosen operation.																						
																									
Questions																									
Is there a limit of user inputs? Inputs number fixed as 2 numbers.																		
Are there several input fields (one per number) or one? One.																			
If there is only one, how is the correct input? Is there a separator per number (e.g. comma and/or space)? Comma, space is optional	
Which mathematical operations are available to user? Add/Subtract																			
																									
Test cases:	
What if character/ special symbol/ punctuation mark except comma is prompted? 					
    1,@,7,3 => false; 1,2,7,3 => true; 1, 2, 7, 3 => true;																	
What if only 1 number is prompted?					
    1 => false	1, 2 => true																		
What if input field is empty?
    "" => false																			
What if input field has no separators?					
    01226354 => false
What if user does not select from dropdownlist?
    Program should wait for selection.																			
																									
Input constraints: 	
    only numbers can be used in th input field																							
	fixed amount of numbers in the input field is 2																								
	separator in the input field - comma, space																								
																									
Input:	Input 2 numbers in one field, separated by comma																								
Processes: select needed operation, compare the numbers, fulfill the operation																							
Output:	The result of adding/subtraction																					
																									
AddNumbers																									
	INITIALIZE userInput AS String;																								
	INITIALIZE counter;																								
	INITIALIZE numbersList AS List;																								
	INITIALIZE result as 0;																								
	INITIALIZE dropdownValue1 as "Add"																								
	INITIALIZE dropdownValue2 as "Subtract"																								
																									
	PROMPT "Please input 2 numbers, separated by commas" AS userInput																								
	SPLIT userInput AT THE SEPERATOR "," TO numbersList // check for spaces, are there commas in the string																								
																									
	FOR EACH item OF numbersList 																								
		IF not a number																							
		PROMPT ("Please make sure that you only add single numbers")																							
		END IF 																							
	END FOR EACH																								
	
    PROMPT "Please select if you want to add or subtract the numbers?" AS dropdownlist
																							
	IF dropdownValue is "Subtract"																								
		SUBTRACT number2 from number1																							
			IF result is negative,																						
			biggestnumber = number2, 																						
			result = number2 - number1																						
			DISPLAY "Result of substraction of number1 from number2 is "+result																						
																									
			ELSE IF result equals zero,																						
			DISPLAY "Numbers are equal. Substraction result is 0"																						
																									
			ELSE																						
			biggestnumber = number1																						
			result = number1 - number2																						
			DISPLAY "Result of substraction of number2 from number1 is "+result																						
			END IF																						
	ELSE																								
			result = number1+number2																						
			DISPLAY "Result of adding is "+result																					
	END IF
