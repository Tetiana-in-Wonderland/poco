Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz".

1. There is numbersList from 1 to 100
2. Display all numbers from the list in a column, using next rules: 
    IF number/3=wholenumber AND number/5=wholenumber
        DISPLAY "FizzBuzz"
    ELSEIF number/3=whole number
        DISPLAY "Fizz"
    ELSEIF number/5=wholenumber
        DISPLAY "BUZZ"
    ELSE 
        DISPLAY "number"
END
